2. [Everything you ever wanted to know about constant lookup in Ruby](https://cirw.in/blog/constant-lookup.html)
  - for me, this is a difficult article. I've tried read it several times, but still can't 100% digest it. However, this latest time reading made progress.
  - I've set a todo to reread this article in one month later.
  - Module.nesting
  - Module.class_eval
  - Binding class in Summary
3. Inheritance and Variable Scope


### Day 01: Sep 28th, Monday
**Today's Progress**:

1. [Towards a Conceptual Model of Object Oriented Programming](https://medium.com/launch-school/towards-a-conceptual-model-of-object-oriented-programming-118eb971659f)
  - An important point that David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto make about instance variables in their book **_The Ruby Programming Language_**: "All Ruby objects have a set of instance variables. These are not defined by the object's class — they are simply created when a value is assigned to them.” Classes don't define instance variables, they define attributes. Instance variables do not exist prior to an object being created and a value being assigned to them.
  - Some vocabularies that can be noticed are: **attribute**, **essence**, **predetermine**
2. LS Lecture: Collaborator Objects
